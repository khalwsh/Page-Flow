PageFlow â€“ Smooth management of books and records.

## About the Project

A streamlined library management system that simplifies book tracking, member management, and lending operations. The application features an intuitive interface for cataloging books, managing patron records, and processing checkouts/returns. Librarians can easily search the collection, generate reports on overdue items, and send automated notifications to members. Built with efficiency and user experience in mind, this system helps libraries transition from paper-based processes to a modern digital solution.
